# Security Policy

## **1. Protection, Detection, and Response**

The **Levilde Luminia** Security Response Center is part of the defenders' community, always at the forefront of security response. We work closely with security researchers to protect our customers and the broader ecosystem from threats.

## **2. Reporting Vulnerabilities**

**Levilde Luminia** follows the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process. We encourage you to follow the guidelines below to help us protect our customers and ecosystem from potential harm.

You can contact us via [**admin email**](mailto:email@levilde.com), or directly report vulnerabilities to the developers of the following open-source software:

- [**Debian 12**](https://www.debian.org/security/)
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/)
- [**Nginx**](https://nginx.org/en/security_advisories.html)
- [**Emby**](https://emby.media/)
- [**Jellyseerr**](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr)
- [**EmbyBoss**](https://github.com/berry8838/Sakura_embyboss)
- [**MariaDB**](https://mariadb.org/)
- [**Rclone**](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/security)
- [**MoviePilot**](https://github.com/jxxghp/MoviePilot)

## **3. Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Method**

According to the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, researchers should report vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or services directly to the affected product's vendor. The typical process for coordinated disclosure is as follows:

1. Researchers first report the vulnerability privately to the vendor.
2. National CERTs or other coordinators may also report the vulnerability privately.
3. If allowed by the researcher, the vendor will fix the vulnerability and provide an update or solution that has been thoroughly tested.

Researchers and vendors maintain close collaboration throughout the investigation to ensure the vulnerability is addressed in a timely manner. After the update is released, the vendor reports progress to the researcher and discloses the vulnerability publicly when appropriate.

If the vulnerability is actively being exploited and the vendor has not yet fixed it, researchers and vendors will work as closely as possible to disclose it publicly as soon as possible to protect customer safety.
